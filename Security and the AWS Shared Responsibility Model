Here‚Äôs a **simple English explanation** of **Reading 1.5: Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model**:

---

### üîê What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

When you use AWS Cloud, **security is a team effort**:

* **AWS handles some parts**.
* **You handle other parts**.

This is called the **Shared Responsibility Model**, where:

* **AWS** is responsible for **security *of* the cloud**.
* **You** (the customer) are responsible for **security *in* the cloud**.

---

### ‚úÖ What is **AWS responsible for**?

**AWS secures the physical and technical parts** of the cloud, like:

* Buildings and data centers (physical security).
* Hardware, servers, storage, and networking.
* Core software systems (like host OS and virtualization).

AWS responsibility depends on the service type:

| **Category**        | **Example** | **AWS Handles**                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure      | EC2         | Physical servers, networking, virtualization |
| Container services  | RDS         | + Operating system and platform              |
| Abstracted services | S3          | + Data encryption and protection             |

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª What are **you (the customer) responsible for**?

You are in charge of:

* Configuring services properly
* Protecting your data
* Managing who has access to what

Your responsibility also depends on the service type:

| **Category**        | **You Handle**                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure      | OS, apps, encryption, data security              |
| Container services  | Data encryption, firewall rules, backups         |
| Abstracted services | Managing your data, using client-side encryption |

---

### üìå Examples of your responsibilities:

* Pick the **right Region** for legal/data privacy rules.
* Turn on **encryption and backups**.
* Use **access control** to limit who can access your AWS resources.

### üîÅ Summary

| **Responsibility**      | **AWS**                                             | **You (Customer)**                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Security *of* the cloud | Data centers, hardware, core infrastructure         | ‚ùå                                                  |
| Security *in* the cloud | ‚ùå                                                   | Data protection, access, configuration             |
| Infrastructure Services | Infra setup                                         | OS, apps, encryption                               |
| Container Services      | Infra + OS + platform                               | Your data, firewalls, backups                      |
| Abstracted Services     | Almost everything (infra, OS, platform, encryption) | Your data, access controls, client-side encryption |

This model helps clearly define **who is responsible for what** when using AWS.
