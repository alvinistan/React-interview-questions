Here are **detailed yet simple notes** for **Reading 1.7: Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** ‚Äî covering **all important points** clearly:

---

## üîê What is IAM (Identity and Access Management)?

* IAM is a **web service** provided by AWS to **control who can access your AWS account** and **what they can do**.
* IAM helps with:

  * **Authentication** ‚Äì Proves who you are (like logging in with a username and password).
  * **Authorization** ‚Äì Grants permissions (like who can access which AWS services or resources).
* **You don't need to share your AWS root account** with others. Instead, use IAM to create users and assign access.

---

## üí° Why Use IAM?

* Allows **secure sharing of AWS resources**.
* Offers **fine-grained permissions** ‚Äì you can control who can access what.
* Helps avoid **credential sharing**.
* **Free** ‚Äì IAM is provided at no extra cost.

---

## üåç IAM Global Scope

* IAM is **global**, not region-specific.
* You can access IAM settings from **any AWS Region**.

## üîß IAM Features

| Feature                               | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** | Adds extra security using OTP codes.                                                      |
| **Password Policies**                 | Set rules like password length, complexity, rotation, etc.                                |
| **Federation Support**                | Users from external sources (e.g., Google, corporate network) can access AWS temporarily. |
| **Free to Use**                       | No extra cost for using IAM.                                                              |
| **Integrated with AWS**               | Works with most AWS services automatically.                                               |

## üë§ IAM User

* An **IAM user** is a person or application that **interacts with AWS services**.
* Each user has:

  * A **username**
  * **Login credentials** (password for console access, access keys for CLI/API)
* You can give **programmatic access** or **AWS Console access**, or both.

---

## üìÇ IAM Group

* A group is a **collection of IAM users**.
* All users in the group **share the same permissions**.
* Easier to manage when many users need the **same level of access**.
* **Best Practice**: Use groups instead of assigning permissions to each user one by one.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Using Groups:

* **New user?** Just add to the right group.
* **Job role changed?** Move user to another group.
* **Better visibility** and **simpler management**.

### üí° Group Notes:

* Groups can have **many users**.
* Users can belong to **multiple groups**.
* **Groups cannot belong to other groups.**

---

## üõë AWS Root User

* The root user has **full access** to all AWS resources.
* **Never use the root user** for everyday tasks.
* Protect it with **MFA** and keep it secure.

---

## üßæ IAM Policy

* IAM Policies define **what actions are allowed or denied** on AWS resources.
* Policies are written in **JSON format**.
* You attach policies to:

  * IAM **Users**
  * IAM **Groups**
  * IAM **Roles**

---

### üß± IAM Policy Structure

| Element    | Description                                 | Required | Example                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Effect`   | Allow or Deny                               | ‚úî        | `"Effect": "Allow"`                    |
| `Action`   | List of operations the policy allows/denies | ‚úî        | `"Action": "s3:ListBucket"`            |
| `Resource` | What AWS resource is affected               | ‚úî        | `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"` |

---

## üß™ Example Policies

### 1. **Administrator Policy** (Full Access)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

* Grants **all actions** on **all resources**.

---

### 2. **Self-Access Policy** (Limited to the user's own account)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "iam:ChangePassword",
      "iam:GetUser"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"
  }]
}
```

* Allows the user to **change their own password** and **view their own account info**.
* Uses **`${aws:username}`** to apply it only to the logged-in user.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

| Tip                                                                 | Why It Matters                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Use IAM groups instead of assigning permissions to individual users | Easier to manage and scale      |
| Apply the least privilege principle                                 | Give only necessary permissions |
| Enable MFA for root and IAM users                                   | Increases security              |
| Rotate access keys regularly                                        | Avoid long-term key exposure    |
| Use roles for applications and external access                      | More secure than sharing keys   |
