Here are **short notes** for **Reading 1.6: Protect the AWS Root User** in **simple English**:

---

### üîê **1. Authentication vs Authorization**

* **Authentication**: Confirms **who you are** (e.g., login with email + password).
* **Authorization**: Confirms **what you can do** (e.g., read/write/delete resources).

---

### üëë **2. What is the AWS Root User?**

* The **first user** created when setting up an AWS account.
* Has **full access** to all AWS services and billing info.
* **Very powerful** ‚Äì should be used carefully and rarely.

---

### üîë **3. Root User Credentials**

* **Login access**: Email + password
* **Programmatic access**: Access key ID + secret access key
* Treat access keys like a password ‚Äî **keep them private and secure**.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Best Practices for Root User**

* Use **strong password**.
* **Do not share** password or access keys.
* **Disable/delete** root access keys.
* Use root user **only for specific tasks** (like account setup, billing).
* **Enable MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication) for better protection.

---

### üîê **5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

* Adds an extra layer of security.
* Combines:

  * **Something you know** (password)
  * **Something you have** (one-time code or security device)
* Helps prevent account hacking even if the password is stolen.
